         * Function that analizes an interval from a single-variable mathematical
         * function and returns one of it's roots or an approximation of it by
         * finding the middle value of the interval, with which it analyzes the two
         * sub-intervals and determines which of the two contains the root.
         * It does this continuously until the root is found or the maximum number
         * of iterations are exeeded.
         * 
         * arguments:
         *     func: Function pointer to the single-variable function.
         *     xi: Inferior value of the interval. Any number inside the domain of the function.
         *     xu: Upper value of the interval. Any number inside the domain of the function.
         *     nIter: Max number of iterations.
         *     tol: Desired tolerance.
         *     errorType: string containign the error type.
         * 
         * Returns:
         *     One of the roots inside the interval, or an approximation of it.
         * 
         * Throws:
         *     IterException: When the max number of iterations are exceeded.
         *     IntervalException: When the interval does not contain a root.
