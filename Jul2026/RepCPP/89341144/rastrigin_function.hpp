/**
 * Rastrigin's function is based on the function of De Jong with the addition
 * of cosine modulation to produce many local minima. Thus, the test function is highly
 * multimodal. However, the location of the minima are regularly distributed.
 * It is named after L. A. Rastrigin and was first published 1974 in "Systems of Extremal
 * Control" as 2-dimensional problem and 1991 generalised for n dimensions by H.
 * Mühlenbein, D. Schomisch and J. Born in "The Parallel Genetic Algorithm as
 * Function Optimiser. Parallel Computing".
 *
 * Its optimal parameter = (0, ..., 0) and optimal function value = 0.
