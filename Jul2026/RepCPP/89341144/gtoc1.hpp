/**
 * `GTOC1` is an 8-dimensional optimization problem issued by the ESA:
 * https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gtop/gtoc1.html
 * The underlying goal is to alter the trajectory of an asteroid by hitting it
 * with a spacecraft. To maximize the collision impact, the spacecraft performs
 * multiple gravity assists (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist).
 * This code assumes a planet sequence has been defined, and evaluates the
 * impulse gained from a whole maneuver if the spacecraft arrives at the nth
 * planet at the point in time specified by the nth problem parameter.
