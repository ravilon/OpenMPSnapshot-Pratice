// Implementation details
#include "alpaka/core/Sycl.hpp"

#include <stdexcept>

//! ALPAKA_THROW_ACC either aborts(terminating the program and creating a core dump) or throws std::runtime_error
//! depending on the Acc. The std::runtime_error exception can be caught in the catch block.
//!
//! For CUDA __trap function is used which triggers std::runtime_error but can be caught during wait not exec.
//! For HIP abort() function is used and calls __builtin_trap()
//! For SYCL assert(false) is not used since it can be disabled with the -DNDEBUG compile option. abort() is used
//! although it generates a runtime error instead of aborting in GPUs:
//! "Caught synchronous SYCL exception: Unresolved Symbol <abort> -999 (Unknown PI error)."
//!
//! The OpenMP specification mandates that exceptions thrown by some thread must be handled by the same thread.
//! Therefore std::runtime_error thrown by ALPAKA_THROW_ACC aborts the the program for OpenMP backends. If needed
//! the SIGABRT signal can be caught by signal handler.
