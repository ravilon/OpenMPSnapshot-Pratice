% Monte Carlo approximation of $\pi$
% [Moreno Marzolla](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/moreno.marzolla)
% Last updated: 2023-10-25

The file [omp-pi.c](omp-pi.c) implements a serial Monte Carlo
algorithm for computing the approximate value of $\pi$. Monte Carlo
algorithms use pseudo-random numbers to evaluate some function of
interest.

![Figure 1: Monte Carlo computation of the value of $\pi$](pi_Monte_Carlo.svg)

The idea is simple (see Figure 1). We generate $N$ random points
uniformly distributed over a square with corners at $(-1, -1)$ and
$(1, 1)$, and count the number $I$ of points falling inside the circle
with center $(0,0)$ and unitary radius. Then, we have:

$$
\frac{\text{N. of points inside the circle}}{\text{Total n. of points}} \approx \frac{\text{Area of circle}}{\text{Area of enclosing square}}
$$

from which, substituting the appropriate variables:

$$
\frac{I}{N} \approx \frac{\pi}{4}
$$

hence $\pi \approx 4 I / N$. This estimate becomes more accurate as the
number of points $N$ increases.

The goal of this exercise is to modify the serial program to make use
of shared-memory parallelism using OpenMP.

## The hard (and inefficient) way

Start with a version that uses the `omp parallel` construct. Let $P$
be the number of OpenMP threads; then, the program operates as
follows:

1. The user specifies the number $N$ of points to generate as a
   command-line parameter, and the number $P$ of OpenMP threads using
   the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable.

2. Thread $p$ generates $N/P$ points using `generate_points()` and
   stores the result in `inside[p]`. `inside[]` is an integer array of
   length $P$ that must be declared outside the parallel region, since
   it must be shared across all OpenMP threads.

3. At the end of the parallel region, the master (thread 0) computes
   $I$ as the sum of the content of `inside[]`; from this the estimate
   of $\pi$ can be computed as above.

You may initially assume that the number of points $N$ is a multiple
of $P$; when you get a working program, relax this assumption to make
the computation correct for any value of $N$.

## The better way

A better approach is to let the compiler parallelize the "for" loop in
`generate_points()` using `omp parallel` and `omp for`.  There is a
problem, though: function `int rand(void)` is not thread-safe since it
modifies a global state variable, so it can not be called concurrently
by multiple threads. Instead, we use `int rand_r(unsigned int *seed)`
which is thread-safe but requires that each thread keeps a local
`seed`. We split the `omp parallel` and `omp for` directives, so that
a different local seed can be given to each thread like so:

```C
#pragma omp parallel default(none) shared(n, n_inside)
{
        const int my_id = omp_get_thread_num();
        \/\* Initialization of my_seed is arbitrary \*\/
        unsigned int my_seed = 17 + 19*my_id;
        ...
#pragma omp for reduction(+:n_inside)
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
                \/\* call rand_r(&my_seed) here... \*\/
                ...
        }
        ...
}
```

Compile with:

        gcc -std=c99 -fopenmp -Wall -Wpedantic omp-pi.c -o omp-pi -lm

Run with:

        ./omp-pi [N]

For example, to compute the approximate value of $\pi$ using $P=4$
OpenMP threads and $N=20000$ points:

        OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./omp-pi 20000
