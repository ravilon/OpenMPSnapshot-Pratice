% Inclusive Scan

The file [omp-inclusive-scan.c](omp-inclusive-scan.c) contains a
serial program that computes the _prefix sum_ of an array `v[]` of
length $n$ by applying the inclusive scan operator; the result is
stored in `s[]`. At the end of the operation we therefore have $s[i] =
v[0] + v[1] + \ldots + v[i]$ for each $i = 0, \ldots, n-1$.

Since in shared-memory programming it is often assumed that the number
$P$ of threads is much lower than the problem size ($P \ll n$), it is
not possible to impelment the tree-based computation shown during the
class, which is more appropriate for GPUs. Therefore, we use a
different strategy, called _blocked scan_ (refer to Figure 1, where $P
= 4$ OpenMP threads are assumed).

![Figure 1: Blocked inclusive scan](omp-inclusive-scan.svg)

Each thread operates on portions of `v[]` and `s[]` whose endpoints are
determined appropriately.

1. Each thread performs an inclusive scan of its own portion of `v[]`
   using the serial algorithm. The result is stored in the
   corresponding portion of `s[]`.

2. The value of the last element of each block of `s[]` is copied to a
   temporary shared array `blksum[]` of length $P$.

3. The master computes the inclusive scan `blksum[]`, storing the
   result on a new array `blksum_s[]`; it would also be possible to
   store the result inside `blksum []` without use a separate array.

4. Each thread $p$ adds `blksum_[p]` to all elements of their own
   portion of `s[]`.

At the end, `s[]` contains the sum-inclusive scan `v[]`

Stages 1 and 4 can be done in parallel by OpenMP threads since they
are embarrassingly parallel.

Compile with:

        gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic -fopenmp omp-inclusive-scan.c -o omp-inclusive-scan

Run with:
