% Dot product
% [Moreno Marzolla](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/moreno.marzolla)

The file [omp-dot.c](omp-dot.c) contains a serial program that
computes the dot product of two arrays `v1[]` and `v2[]`. The program
receives the array lengths $n$ as the only parameter on the command
line. The arrays are initialized deterministically, so that their
scalar product is known awithout computing it explicitly.  The dot
product of `v1[]` and `v2[]` is defined as:

$$
\sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} v1[i] \times v2[i]
$$

The goal of this exercise is to parallelize the serial program using
the `omp parallel` construct with the appropriate clauses. It is
instructive to begin without using the `omp parallel for` directive
and computing the endpoints of the iterations explicitly.  To this
aim, let $P$ be the size of the OpenMP team; partition the
arrays into $P$ blocks of approximately uniform size. Thread $p$ ($0
\leq p < P$) computes the dot product `my_p` of the subvectors with
indices $\texttt{my_start}, \ldots, \texttt {my_end}-1$:

$$
\texttt{my_p}: = \sum_{i=\texttt{my_start}}^{\texttt{my_end}-1} v1[i] \times v2[i]
$$

There are several ways to accumulate partial results. One possibility
is to store the value computed by thread $p$ on `partial_p[p]`, where
`partial_p[]` is an array of length $P$. In this way each thread
writes on different elements of `partial_p[]` and no race conditions
are possible. After the parallel region completes, the master thread
computes the final result by summing the content of `partial_p[]`. Be
sure to handle the case where $n$ is not an integer multiple of $P$
correctly.

The solution above is instructive but tedious and inefficient.  Unless
there are specific reasons to do so, in practice you should use the
`omp parallel for` directive with the `reduction()` clause, and let
the compiler take care of everything.

To compile:

        gcc -fopenmp -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic omp-dot.c -o omp-dot

To execute:

        ./omp-dot [n]

For example, if you want to use two OpenMP threads:

        OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./omp-dot 1000000
