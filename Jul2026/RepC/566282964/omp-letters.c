The file [omp-letters.c](omp-letters.c) contains a serial program that
computes the number of occurrences of the letters 'a'...'z' in an
ASCII file read from standard input. No distinction is made between
upper and lowercase characters; non-letter characters are ignored. We
provide some text documents to experiment with, courtesy of the
[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). You should observe
that the character frequencies are about the same across the
documents, despite the fact that they have been written by different
authors. Indeed, the relative frequencies of characters are
language-dependent but author-independent. You are encouraged to
experiment with books in other languages, also available on [Project
Gutenberg Web site](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

The goal of this exercise is to modify the function `make_hist(text,
hist)` to use of OpenMP parallelism. The function takes as parameter a
pointer `text` to a zero-terminated string representing the document,
and an uninitialized array `hist[26]`. At the end, `hist[0]` must
contain the occurrences of the letter `a` in `text`, `hist[1]` the
occurrences of the letter `b`, up to `hist[25]` that represents the
occurrences of the letter `z`.

A reasonable approach is to partition the text among the OpenMP
threads, so that each thread computes the frequencies of a block of
text; the final result is the vector sum of all local histograms.

Start by partitioning the text manually as described below, i.e.,
without using the `omp for` directive; this helps you to better
understand how partitioning is done, but in practice `omp for` is
easier to use and results in more readable code.

Since the text is a character array of length `TEXT_LEN`, thread $p$
computes the extremes of its chunk as:

```C
const int from = (TEXT_LEN * p) / num_threads;
const int to = (TEXT_LEN * (p+1)) / num_threads;
```

where `num_threads` is the size of OpenMP team. Thread $p$ will
compute the frequencies of the characters in `text[from .. (to-1)]`.

You need to create a shared, two-dimensional array
`local_hist[num_threads][26]` initialized to zero. Thread $p$ operates
on `local_hist[p][]` so that no race conditions are possible. If
thread $p$ sees character $x$, $x \in \{\texttt{'a'}, \ldots,
\texttt{'z'}\}$, it will increase the value `local_hist[p][x - 'a']`.
When all threads are done, the master computes the result as the
column-wise sum of `local_hist`. In other words, the number of
occurrences of the character (`'a'` + _c_)  is

$$
\texttt{hist}[c] = \sum_{p=0}^{\texttt{num_threads}-1} \texttt{local_hist}[p][c]
$$

Also, don't forget that there is a reduction on `nlet` that reports
the number of letters; this might be done using the `reduction()`
clause of the `omp for` directive.

A simpler solution involves the use of the `omp parallel for`
directive with array reduction that is available since OpenMP 4.5. To
perform the sum-reduction on each element of `hist[ALPHA_SIZE]` use
the following syntax:

#pragma omp parallel for ... reduction(+:hist[:ALPHA_SIZE])

(`ALPHA_SIZE` is a symbol defined at the beginning of the program,
with value 26; you can use the literal `26` as well). This works like
a scalar reductions, with the differences that the compiler actually
computes `ALPHA_SIZE` sum-reductions on `hist[0]`,
... `hist[ALPHA_SIZE - 1]`.

Compile with:

gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic -fopenmp omp-letters.c -o omp-letters
