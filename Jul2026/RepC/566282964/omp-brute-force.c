![[DES cracker board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker) developed in 1998 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF); this device can be used to brute-force a DES key. The original uploader was Matt Crypto at English Wikipedia. Later versions were uploaded by Ed g2s at en.wikipedia - CC BY 3.0 us, <https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2437815>](des-cracker.jpg)

The program [omp-brute-force.c](omp-brute-force.c) contains an
encrypted message stored in the array `enc[]` of length 64.  The
message has been encrypted using the _XOR_ algorithm, which applies
the "exclusive or" (xor) operator between the plaintext and the
encryption key. The _XOR_ algorithm is not secure, unless the key is
truly random and has the same length of the plaintext; however, it is
"good enough" for this exercise.

_XOR_ is a _symmetric_ encryption algorithm, meaning that the same key
is used for encryption and decryption. The function `xorcrypt(in, out,
n, key, keylen)` encrypts or decrypts a message with a given key. To
encrypt, `in` pointw to the plaintext and `out` to a memory buffer
where the ciphertext will be stored. To decrypt, `in` points to the
ciphertext and `out` to a memory buffer where the plaintext will be
stored.

The parameters are as follows:

- `in` points to the source message. This buffer does not need to be
zero-terminated since it may contain an encrypted message.

- `out` points to a memory buffer of at least $n$ Bytes (the same
length of the source message), that must be allocated by the caller.
At the end, this buffer contains the source message that has been
encrypted/decrypted with the encryption key.

- `n` is the length, in Bytes, of the source message.

- `key` points to the encryption/decryption key. The key is a sequence
of arbitrary bytes, and therefore does not need to be
zero-terminated.

- `keylen` is the length of the encryption/decryption key.

The _XOR_ algorithm will happily decrypt any message with any key; if
the key is not correct, the decrypted message will not make any
sense.

For this exercise we know that the plaintext is a zero-terminated
ASCII string that begins with `0123456789`. We also know that the
encryption key is a sequence of 8 ASCII numeric characters; therefore,
the key is a string from `"00000000"` and `"99999999"`. The goal is to
write a program to brute-force the key using OpenMP. The program
should try every key until a valid message is found, i.e., a message
that begins with `0123456789`. At the end, the program must print the
plaintext, which is a famous quote from [an old
film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames).

The main loop can not be parallelized with the `omp for` construct
(why?). Therefore, we use `omp parallel` and manually partition the
key space among threads. Remember that `omp parallel` can be applied
to a _structured block_, i.e., a block with a single entry and a
single exit point. Therefore, the thread who finds the correct key can
not exit the block using `return`, `break` or `goto` (the compiler
should give a compile-time error). Howver, we need to terminate the
program at most shortly after the correct key is found. How?

Compile with:

gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic -fopenmp omp-brute-force.c -o omp-brute-force

Run with:

OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./omp-brute-force

**Note**: the execution time of the parallel program might change
irregularly depending on $P$. Why?
