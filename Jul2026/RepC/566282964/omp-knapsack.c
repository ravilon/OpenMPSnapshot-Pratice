The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a well-known optimization problem that is
part of the general family of _Knapsack problems_. The input consists
of $n$ items of positive integer weights $w_0, \ldots, w_{n-1}$ and
real, nonnegative values $v_0, \ldots, v_{n-1}$. We are also given a
knapsack that can hold any number of items, provided that the total
weight does not exceed a given capacity $C$.  The goal is to identify
the subset of items of maximum total values whose total weight is less
than or equal to $C$. The following explanation of the algorithm is
not required to solve this exercise; however, I suggest you to read it
to grasp at least the main idea behind the code.

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let $P(i,j)$,
$i=0, \ldots, (n-1)$, $j=0, \ldots, C$ be a family of problems defined
as follows:

> $P(i,j)$ consists of finding the subset of items chosen among $\{0,
> \ldots, i\}$ whose total weight is less than or equal to $j$ and
> whose total value is maximum possible.

The solution of the 0-1 Knapsack problem is then the solution of
$P(n-1, C)$.

Let $V(i,j)$ the maximum value of a subset of items $\{0, \ldots, i\}$
whose total weight is less than or equal to $j$ (in other word,
let $V(i,j)$ be the solution of problem $P(i,j)$).

We know that $V(i,0) = 0$; indeed, in a container of zero capacity no
item can be inserted.

Regarding $V(0,j)$, only the first item with weight $w_0$ and value
$v_0$ is available. Therefore, the only possibilities is to insert the
item into the knapsack or not. If the capacity of the knapsack is at
least $j$, the maximum value can be obtained by inserting the
item. Otherwise, the maximum value is zero. Therefore, we can write:

$$
V(0,j) = \begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{if}\ j < w_0\\
v_0 & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

The general case is a bit tricky. The solution of $P(i,j)$ may or may
not use item $i$. We have the following cases:

1. If $w_i > j$, the weight of item $i$ exceeds by itself the capacity
   of the knapsack, so that item $i$ can definitely not be used.
   Therefore, the optimal solution $V(i,j)$ of problem $P(i,j)$ will
   not contain item $i$, and will then be the same as the optimal
   solution $V(i-1,j)$ of problem $P(i-1,j)$.

2. If $w_i \leq j$, then we may or may not use item $i$. The choice
   depends on which alternative provides the better outcome:

    a. If we choose to use item $i$, then the solution $V(i,j)$ of
       problem $P(i,j)$ is $V(i-1,j-w_i)+v_i$: indeed, we use item $i$
       of value $v_i$, and fill the residual capacity $j - w_i$ with
       the items chosen among $\{0, 1, \ldots, i-1\}$ that provide the
       maximum value. Such maximum value is the solution $V(i-1,
       j-w_i)$ of $P(i-1, j-w_i)$.

    b. If we choose not to use item $i$, the maximum value that we can
       put into the knapsack is $V(i-1, j)$ as in case 1 above.

So, should be use item $i$ or not? We choose the alternative among 2.a
and 2.b that maximizes the total value.  Therefore, for any $i=1,
\ldots, (n-1)$, $j=0, \ldots, C$ we write:

$$
V(i,j) = \begin{cases}
V(i-1, j) & \mbox{if}\ j < w_i\\
\max\{V(i-1, j), V(i-1, j-w_i) + v_i\} & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

With a slight modification of the algorithm above it is possible to
keep track of which items belong to the optimal solution.  For the
sake of simplicity, in this exercise we only compute the value of the
optimal solution.

The file [omp-knapsack.c](omp-knapsack.c) contains a serial program
that solves the 0-1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming.  Input
instances are read from a text file whose name is provided as the only
command-line parameter. The input files have a very simple structure:

- The first value is the maximum capacity $C$ (integer);

- The second value is the number of items $n$ (integer);

- After that, $n$ pairs $(w_i, v_i)$ are listed, separated by blanks.

The program [knapsack-gen.c](knapsack-gen.c) can be used to generate
random instances for additional experiments.

The goal is to modify the program to make use of shared-memory
parallelism using OpenMP.

Compile with:

        gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic opencl-knapsack.c -o opencl-knapsack -lm

Run with:

        ./omp-knapsack [input file]

For example, to use $P=4$ OpenMP threads:

        OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./omp-knapsack knap-10-10.in
