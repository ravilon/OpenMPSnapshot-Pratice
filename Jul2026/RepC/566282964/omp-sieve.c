The _sieve of Erathostenes_ is an algorithm for identifying the prime
numbers within the set $\{2, \ldots, n\}$. An integer $p \geq 2$ is
prime if and only if its only divisors are 1 and $p$ itself (2 is
prime).

To illustrate how the sieve of Eratosthenes works, let us consider
$n=20$. We start by listing all integers $2, \ldots n$:

![](omp-sieve1.svg)

The first value in the list (2) is prime; we mark all its multiples,
and get:

![](omp-sieve2.svg)

The next unmarked value (3) is prime. We mark all its multiples
starting from $3 \times 3$, since $3 \times 2$ has already been marked
as a multiple of two. We get:

![](omp-sieve3.svg)

The next unmarked value (5) is prime. The smaller unmarked multiple of
5 is $5 \times 5$, because $5 \times 2$, $5 \times 3$ and $5 \times 4$
have already been marked as multiples of 2 and 3. However, since $5
\times 5$ is outside the upper bound of the interval, the algorithm
terminates and all unmarked numbers are prime:

The file [omp-sieve.c](omp-sieve.c) contains a serial program that
takes as input an integer $n \geq 2$, and computes the number $\pi(n)$
of primes in the set $\{2, \ldots n\}$ using the sieve of
Eratosthenes[^1]. Although the serial program could be made more
efficient, for the sake of this exercise we trade efficiency for
readability.

The set of unmarked numbers in $\{2, \ldots, n\}$ is represented by
the `isprime[]` array of length $n+1$; during execution, `isprime[k]`
is 0 if and only if $k$ has been marked, i.e., has been determined to
be composite; `isprime[0]` and `isprime[1]` are not used.

[^1]: $\pi(n)$ is the [prime-counting
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function)

The goal of this exercise is to write a parallel version of the sieve
of Erathostenes; to this aim, you might want to use the following
hints.

The function `primes()` contains the loop:

```C
nprimes = n - 1;
for (i=2; ((long)i)*i <= (long)n; i++) {
if (isprime[i]) {
nprimes -= mark(isprime, i, i*i, n+1);
}
}
```

To compute $\pi(n)$ we start by initializing `nprimes` as the number
of elements in the set $\{2, \ldots n\}$; every time we mark a value
for the first time, we decrement `nprimes` so that, at the end, we
have $\pi(n) = \texttt{nprimes}$.

The function `mark()` has the following signature:

int mark( char *isprime, int k, int from, int to )

and its purpose is to mark all multiples of `k`, starting from $k
\times k$, that belong to the set $\{\texttt{from}, \ldots,
\texttt{to}-1\}$.  The function returns the number of values that have
been marked _for the first time_.

It is not possible to parallelize the loop above, because the array
`isprime[]` is modified by the function `mark()`, and this represents
a _loop-carried dependency_. However, it is possible to parallelize
the body of function `mark()` (refer to the provided source code). The
idea is to partition the set $\{\texttt{from}, \ldots \texttt{to}-1\}$
among $P$ threads so that every thread will mark all multiples of $k$
that belong to its partition.

I suggest that you start using the `omp parallel` construct (not `omp
parallel for`) and compute the bounds of each partition by hand.  It
is not trivial to do so correctly, but this is quite instructive since
during the lectures we only considered the simple case of partitioning
a range $0, \ldots, n-1$, while here the range does not start at zero.

Once you have a working parallel version, you can take the easier
route to use the `omp parallel for` directive and let the compiler
partition the iteration range for you.

To compile:

gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wpedantic -fopenmp omp-sieve.c -o omp-sieve

To execute:

./omp-sieve [n]

Example:

OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./omp-sieve 1000

Table 1 shows the values of the prime-counting function $\pi(n)$ for
some $n$. Use the table to check the correctness of your
implementation.
